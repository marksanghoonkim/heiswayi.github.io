Nowadays, I started to use GitHub for almost everything. Time to time, my GitHub repositories (shorten as "repo(s)") and gists (code snippets) are increasing. Having so many repos and gists make me harder to look for the old projects or snippets. So, what I do is I create a listing webpage and fetch all my repos by using GitHub API and gather them in a grid view. Also, same goes to my gists.
