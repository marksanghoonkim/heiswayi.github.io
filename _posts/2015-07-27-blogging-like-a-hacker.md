Back in 2008, the Founder of [GitHub](https://github.com), **Tom Preston-Werner** wrote [Blogging Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) (a recommended read), introducing [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, blog aware, static site generator. In his blog post, Tom thoroughly elaborated how Jekyll works with GitHub.

Today, Tom's idea has evolved to become [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), a fully-fledged, free hosting service for static webpages on GitHub where we can write our pages in a simple [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) language, organize theme in a straightforward directory structure and then, let the GitHub does the rest.

In the past few years, I have been using [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) all the times. I don't even know about this static blog generator because I never use GitHub before. Just starting this year, I started using GitHub for my projects. Some time later, I started exploring Jekyll and interested to use it for my new personal blog.

Even more, this makes me more exciting after I found [a bunch of folks](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites) has been using the software for their sites.

## Here are the reasons why I switched to Jekyll & GitHub

**NO SERVER-SIDE SETUP**

Tom created Jekyll to enable people to blog using a simple static HTML website, with all of the content hosted freely and version-controlled on GitHub. The goal was to eliminate the complexity of other blogging platforms by creating rapid workflow that allow me to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). GitHub Pages serves my website directly from my GitHub repository so that I don't have to deal with any hosting. No database and no CMS. GitHub can serve as a CMS if needed because I can edit the content on it.

**FAST, MINIMAL & SECURE**

Jekyll is fast because being stripped down and without a database, I'm just serving up the static pages. No database calls are made when a page is loaded. For people like me who admires the simplicity in the workflow, my Jekyll website includes absolutely no functionality or features that I'm not using. I can just focus directly to my writing content. Plus, the vast majority of vulnerabilities that affect platforms like WordPress don't exist because Jekyll has no CMS, database or PHP. So, I don't have to spend as much time to keep up with the security updates.

**COMPLETE CONTROL OVER DESIGN & CONTENT**

To start a Jekyll blog is quite easy, you can just fork any free Jekyll theme as a start point and begin publishing. Most of them (Jekyll themes) I found here (on GitHub) are released under MIT license. So you can spend less time wrestling with complex templates by other people and more time creating your own theme or customizing an uncomplicated base theme. As for me, I forked one of them as the base theme, then started customizing the theme in any way I please. You can find more themes on [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io) to begin with.

**MARKDOWN & LOCAL DEVELOPMENT**

I started to love markdown because it's a distraction free writing tool. All I need is a little practice to be familiar with the syntaxes. Refering to [Mastering Markdown by GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) is just enough to make me skillful when writing in markdown. Other than this, when you create a file (e.g. page or post) with `.md` extension, you can do that in your local computer as a local development if there is no Internet connection. When you're back online, you can just sync or push up some commits and deploy it to the remote host on your GitHub. You may do this using git commands or via GitHub GUI software. I also can access my blog, create a new file or edit the existing file online via the GitHub site itself. Even if GitHub goes down, I still have the backup in my local computer.

### My Working Environment and Editor Software

I'm using Windows because most of my professional works are on Windows environment. For editor software, my default is [Notepad2-mod](http://xhmikosr.github.io/notepad2-mod). I use it as a replacement to the default Notepad program. Sometimes, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Atom](https://atom.io) (my favorite one). Since I'm working on Windows, I installed [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com) software on my computer to work with GitHub. Depending to my mood, sometimes I either use GitHub GUI software or Git Shell to push/manage my repos to/on GitHub. Sometimes, I just manage them directly on the GitHub site.

### Conclusion

Simplicity is everything. Some people said; `Less is more.` Being a minimalist is not that simple. But being a minimalist is a part of myself. I try my best to utilize everything around me. That's what I called *"The Essential of Life"*.

[**Jekyll**](http://jekyllrb.com) + [**GitHub**](https://pages.github.com) + [**Markdown**](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) = **Blogging like a Hacker**
